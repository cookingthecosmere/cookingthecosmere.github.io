# Cooking the Cosmere: Notes and Errata

This page includes information about the unofficial _Cooking the Cosmere_ recipe collection,
distributed at [Dragonsteel Nexus 2024](https://tabletop.events/conventions/dragonsteel-2024). In
order to keep the book a somewhat reasonable size, some details were left out. You can find those
and answers to frequently asked questions.

It is under construction and will soon contain additional information.

If you have any questions about the cookbook or any included recipes, feel free to email me at
bryan.vanderhoof@gmail.com or find me on the
[Sanderson Collectors Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/scg), where I'm `@brynomial`.

## Ingredients

### Salt

Salt comes in many varieties, but typically the main variables are mineral content and crystal
size/shape. These reflect how the salt was made and where it comes from and can affect flavor and
density.

Common variations include:
* Table salt: salt mines are flooded with water, dissolving the rock salt and creating a brine. The
  brine is pumped to the surface, where it is boiled to produce crystals. These get washed to
  remove other minerals, then ground into their final form. Due to the fine grind and compact form,
  table salt is quite salty; it can also be somewhat acrid due to additives (such as iodides and
  anti-caking agents).
* Kosher salt: mined similar to table salt, but the brine is typically air-dried to produce specific
  crystal shapes, which are then washed to remove most other minerals. Different brands of kosher
  salt produce different crystal shapes. Some, such as Morton, produce a flat crystal, which is
  relatively compact (though not so much as table salt). Others, such as Diamond Crystal, produce
  pyramidal crystals, which take up more space. Given these shape differences, a teaspoon of
  Morton's salt may contain up to two times as much actual salt as Diamond Crystal (making your food
  that much saltier).
* Sea salt: produced by drying sea water, often via air/sun evaporation. Sometimes this salt is then
  processed to produce something similar to kosher or table salt, but sometimes the minerals are
  intentionally left in to improve the flavor. Can be left in a larger crystalline form, or ground
  fine.
  * Grey salt: sea salt with significant mineral content, which hasn't been fully dried. It retains
    a greyish color due to the minerals, and is often left coarse with a slightly humid feeling
  * Fleur de sel: sea salt that has been sun-dried in special pans to create large flakes. These are
    very crunchy and used as a finishing salt.
* Himalayan pink salt: rock salt mined in crystalline form from the Punjab. It contains several
  trace minerals that provide the color.
* Smoked salt: a flavored salt, typically a coarse grind of sea or kosher salt. The crystals are
  smoked until they turn black, and they impart a smoky flavor when used as a finishing salt

All of the receipes in this book use *Diamond Crystal kosher salt*. If using table salt or Morton's
kosher salt, consider halving the suggested quantities and adjusting to taste.
