      <h1>Cooking the Cosmere: Notes and Errata</h1>
<p>This page includes information about the unofficial <em>Cooking the Cosmere</em> recipe collection,
distributed at <a href="https://tabletop.events/conventions/dragonsteel-2024">Dragonsteel Nexus 2024</a>. In
order to keep the book a somewhat reasonable size, some details were left out. You can find those
and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>
<p>It is under construction and will soon contain additional information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the cookbook or any included recipes, feel free to email me at
bryan.vanderhoof@gmail.com or find me on the

<h2>Digital Copy</h2>
<p>You can download a <a href="assets/vol1.pdf">screen-friendly copy</a> of the cookbook.</p>
<h2>Errata</h2>
<p><strong>Lavis Bread</strong></p>
<p>This recipe contains a typo. The instructions tell you to add sugar, but the ingredients don't list
it. The correct amount is 250g. You can reduce this if you prefer a less-sweet cornbread, but I
suggest adding extra butter and/or an egg yolk if you do to prevent the cornbread from drying out.</p>
<h2>On Salt</h2>
<p>Salt comes in many varieties, but typically the main variables are mineral content and crystal
size/shape. These reflect how the salt was made and where it comes from and can affect flavor and
density.</p>
<p>Common variations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Table salt</strong>: salt mines are flooded with water, dissolving the rock salt and creating a brine. The
brine is pumped to the surface, where it is boiled to produce crystals. These get washed to
remove other minerals, then ground into their final form. Due to the fine grind and compact form,
table salt is quite salty; it can also be somewhat acrid due to additives (such as iodides and
anti-caking agents).</li>
<li><strong>Kosher salt</strong>: mined similar to table salt, but the brine is typically air-dried to produce specific
crystal shapes, which are then washed to remove most other minerals. Different brands of kosher
salt produce different crystal shapes. Some, such as Morton, produce a flat crystal, which is
relatively compact (though not so much as table salt). Others, such as Diamond Crystal, produce
pyramidal crystals, which take up more space. Given these shape differences, a teaspoon of
Morton's salt may contain up to two times as much actual salt as Diamond Crystal (making your food
that much saltier).</li>
<li><strong>Sea salt</strong>: produced by drying sea water, often via air/sun evaporation. Sometimes this salt is then
processed to produce something similar to kosher or table salt, but sometimes the minerals are
intentionally left in to improve the flavor. Can be left in a larger crystalline form, or ground
fine.
<ul>
<li>Grey salt: sea salt with significant mineral content, which hasn't been fully dried. It retains
a greyish color due to the minerals, and is often left coarse with a slightly humid feeling</li>
<li>Fleur de sel: sea salt that has been sun-dried in special pans to create large flakes. These are
very crunchy and used as a finishing salt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Himalayan pink salt</strong>: rock salt mined in crystalline form from the Punjab. It contains several
trace minerals that provide the color.</li>
<li><strong>Smoked salt</strong>: a flavored salt, typically a coarse grind of sea or kosher salt. The crystals are
smoked until they turn black, and they impart a smoky flavor when used as a finishing salt.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the recipes in this book use <strong>Diamond Crystal kosher salt</strong>. If using table salt or Morton's
kosher salt, consider halving the suggested quantities and adjusting to taste.</p>
<h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
<h3>Chouta</h3>
<p><strong>The Bread</strong></p>
<p>If you don't want to make a bread dough or deep fry a bunch of large discs, the easiest thing is to
get a good, fresh pita, preferably something baked locally. But if you don't have access to that,
any store-bought one you like will work. Heat a couple of tablepoons of oil in a frying pan (ideally
just a little bit larger than your pita) over medium-high, and fry the pita for a minute or two per
side, until it's browning and a little crisp. Remove to a paper towl and sprinkle with a touch of
salt.</p>
<p><strong>The Meatballs</strong></p>
<p>If it's easier, you can replace the meat, spices, and some of the salt with a good chorizo.</p>
<h3>Curries</h3>
<p><strong>The Meat</strong></p>
<p>You really want something that will braise well here, so something on the tougher side with a bit of
fat. I suggest pork shoulder, but I actually used pork short ribs (deboned) when originally making
this recipe, and have tried it with pork jowl. Just don't use something quick-cooking like loin.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger or Curry Leaves</strong></p>
<p>Neither of these is particularly easy to find in most places, so feel free to leave them out. I used
ginger leaves (which you usually find attached to young ginger, which can sometimes be found at fall
farmer's markets or Asian groceries). They have a slight chew and a mild kick.</p>
<p>If you're going to use curry leaves, I suggest heating a couple tablespoons of oil over medium high
and frying the leaves for a few seconds until they're crisp. Then you can dump the oil and the
leaves into the curry.</p>
<p><strong>Spice Level</strong></p>
<p>I use an extra hot cayenne pepper (80K), and find that 3 teaspoons is enough to satisfy my chili
head tendencies for the spicy curry. If you're not as heat tolerant, you may want to use less, or
even replace it with a bit more Kashmiri chili (which isn't particularly hot).</p>
<p>Or just focus on the apricot curry.</p>
<h3>Lavis Bread &amp; Skrip</h3>
<p><strong>Langoustines</strong></p>
<p>These are big, delicious creatures that look like something between a shrimp and a lobster. You can
often source them from a specialty seafood shop or online, but they can be expensive.</p>
<p>The shells are also quite thick and can be sharp, so be very mindful when cutting them open. If
you're not experienced in this area, I recommend wearing a knife glove.</p>
<p>If you'd rather avoid all this entirely, you can use some large shrimp, preferably with their heads
still attached. The innards contribue significantly to the flavor of the sauce.</p>
<p><strong>Lavis Bread</strong></p>
<p>See the note in Errata above about sugar.</p>
<h3>Old Dent's Chips</h3>
<p>This process produces quite light, crispy fries. I like to cut them about 1.5-2 times as thick as a
McDonald's french fry, as you get more potato flavor that way.</p>
<p>This whole process (par cooking and freezing) will produces a well-cooked fry that has a ton of tiny
cracks in the surface. Which the fries hit the oil, those cracks won't be visible, but they will
give the hot oil more surface area to work with, which will produce a more crispy exterior.</p>
<p>Parcooking also means the interiors of the fries will be fully cooked before frying, which means you
can focus on getting them crisp without overbrowning.</p>
<h3>Food for Nobles</h3>
<p>If you can swing it, it's worth getting decent caviar for this.</p>
<h3>Kulunut Bread</h3>
<p>Yes, you can steam this as per Tress's original recipe.</p>
<p>Place it in the pan and position the pan in a steamer over a pan of
simmering water, and allow to steam for 45 minutes. Check for doneness (and possibly to add more
boiling water to the pan underneath), and steam for up to an additional 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I really recommend baking it, though, as the contrast of textures is very nice.</p>
<p><strong>Macadamia Nuts</strong></p>
<p>Most macadamia nuts out there are not great and likely rancid. Unless you live in a place that grows
them, you're best off buying raw nuts from a good seller online. Keep them in the freezer and use
them as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>Roast Venison</h3>
<p>You can use beef, and it'll be delicious if not exactly accurate to the books.</p>
<h3>Ramen</h3>
<p>Read the whole recipe before you start, and give yourself a lot of time. Like, start the broth in
the morning, otherwise you will be up braising pork at 1am.</p>
<p><strong>The Schmaltz</strong></p>
<p>You don't <em>have</em> to make this, but some kind of savory, aromatic oil is really important. If you
don't want to make your own, you can buy schmaltz from some butchers.</p>
<p>You can also make a scallion oil by cooking a bunch of scallions, cut into large pieces, in two cups
of neutral oil over medium-low until the scallions are fully wilted and brown. Discard the scallions
and use the oil in place of the schmaltz.</p>
<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>
<p>I like the simplicity of this presentation, but feel free to add whatever excites you.</p>
