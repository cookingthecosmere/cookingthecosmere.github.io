<h1>Cooking the Cosmere: Notes and Errata</h1>
<p>This page includes information about the unofficial <em>Cooking the Cosmere</em> recipe collection,
distributed at <a href="https://tabletop.events/conventions/dragonsteel-2024">Dragonsteel Nexus 2024</a>. In
order to keep the book a somewhat reasonable size, some details were left out. You can find those
and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>
<p>It is under construction and will soon contain additional information.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Salt</h3>
<p>Salt comes in many varieties, but typically the main variables are mineral content and crystal
size/shape. These reflect how the salt was made and where it comes from and can affect flavor and
density.</p>
<p>Common variations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table salt: salt mines are flooded with water, dissolving the rock salt and creating a brine. The
brine is pumped to the surface, where it is boiled to produce crystals. These get washed to
remove other minerals, then ground into their final form. Due to the fine grind and compact form,
table salt is quite salty; it can also be somewhat acrid due to additives (such as iodides and
anti-caking agents).</li>
<li>Kosher salt: mined similar to table salt, but the brine is typically air-dried to produce specific
crystal shapes, which are then washed to remove most other minerals. Different brands of kosher
salt produce different crystal shapes. Some, such as Morton, produce a flat crystal, which is
relatively compact (though not so much as table salt). Others, such as Diamond Crystal, produce
pyramidal crystals, which take up more space. Given these shape differences, a teaspoon of
Morton's salt may contain up to two times as much actual salt as Diamond Crystal (making your food
that much saltier).</li>
<li>Sea salt: produced by drying sea water, often via air/sun evaporation. Sometimes this salt is then
processed to produce something similar to kosher or table salt, but sometimes the minerals are
intentionally left in to improve the flavor. Can be left in a larger crystalline form, or ground
fine.
<ul>
<li>Grey salt: sea salt with significant mineral content, which hasn't been fully dried. It retains
a greyish color due to the minerals, and is often left coarse with a slightly humid feeling</li>
<li>Fleur de sel: sea salt that has been sun-dried in special pans to create large flakes. These are
very crunchy and used as a finishing salt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Himalayan pink salt: rock salt mined in crystalline form from the Punjab. It contains several
trace minerals that provide the color.</li>
<li>Smoked salt: a flavored salt, typically a coarse grind of sea or kosher salt. The crystals are
smoked until they turn black, and they impart a smoky flavor when used as a finishing salt</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the receipes in this book use <em>Diamond Crystal kosher salt</em>. If using table salt or Morton's
kosher salt, consider halving the suggested quantities and adjusting to taste.</p>
